# Project Status

- Created `base.html` as the main template with a navigation bar.
- The navigation bar is responsive to user authentication status.
- A dark, kid-friendly theme is implemented in `static/css/style.css`.
- User registration and login are functional with custom forms and styling.
- Success messages are displayed after user registration.
- The main landing page for logged-in users (`subject_list.html`) displays a list of subjects in a responsive 3-column grid.
- The subject list is fetched dynamically from the database by the `subject_list` view.
- The subject cards have a wiggle animation on hover.
- The font sizes on the subject page are responsive.
- Users can select a subject and are then presented with a list of levels for that subject (`level_select.html`).
- The levels are dynamically fetched by the `level_select` view.
- The main card on the level select page has a wiggle animation on hover.
- After selecting a level, users are shown a list of chapters for that subject and level (`chapter_list.html`).
- The chapters are dynamically fetched by the `chapter_list` view.
- The main card on the chapter list page has a wiggle animation on hover.
- The final content page (`topic_list.html`) displays the topics and associated resource links for a selected chapter.
- The topics and links are dynamically fetched by the `topic_list` view.
- The main card on the topic list page has a wiggle animation on hover.
- All views are protected by `@login_required` where necessary.
