# Project Status

- Created `base.html` as the main template with a navigation bar.
- The navigation bar is responsive to user authentication status.
- A dark, kid-friendly theme is implemented in `static/css/style.css`.
- User registration and login are functional with custom forms and styling.
- Success messages are displayed after user registration.
- The main landing page for logged-in users (`subject_list.html`) displays a list of subjects in a responsive 3-column grid.
- The subject list is fetched dynamically from the database by the `subject_list` view.
- The subject cards have a wiggle animation on hover.
- The font sizes on the subject page are responsive.
- Users can select a subject and are then presented with a list of levels for that subject (`level_select.html`).
- The levels are dynamically fetched by the `level_select` view.
- After selecting a level, users are shown a list of chapters for that subject and level (`chapter_list.html`).
- The chapters are dynamically fetched by the `chapter_list` view.
- The final content page (`topic_list.html`) displays the topics and associated resource links for a selected chapter.
- The topics and links are dynamically fetched by the `topic_list` view.
- All views are protected by `@login_required` where necessary.
- App-level URLs are defined in `learning/urls.py`.
- Project-level URLs in `lms_project/urls.py` include the app-level URLs.
- The `navbar-brand` link now redirects to the `subject_list` page.
- Styling for messages and form errors has been added.
- The footer has been removed.
- The navbar has been made slimmer.
- The subject cards grid is centered with equal space on both left and right sides of the screen.
- A background image has been added to the `subject_list.html` page only.
- The `h2` element on the `level_select.html` page has been moved to the navbar and its font size matches the subject `h2` in the navbar.
- The levels on the `level_select.html` page are now listed vertically.
- The chapters on the `chapter_list.html` page are now listed vertically.
- The topics on the `topic_list.html` page are now listed vertically.
- Topics on the `topic_list.html` page are clickable to show/hide the resource links.
- The main card on the `level_select.html` page has a wiggle animation on page load.
- The wiggle animation has been removed from the main cards on `chapter_list.html` and `topic_list.html`.
- Increased the font size of the "Select a Level" text, and increased the font size and added a gap between the levels on the `level_select.html` page.
